**Project Overview:**
AllWinRx aims to assist small independent pharmacies in calculating drug price comparisons and potential savings by joining the All Win Rx Group Purchasing Organization (GPO). We developed a comprehensive database and analytical tools to help these pharmacies quantify discounts and improve profitability.

**Problem Addressed:**
Small pharmacies often face high medicine costs due to limited bargaining power. Our project helps these pharmacies evaluate potential savings from GPO memberships, providing them with accurate cost analyses and strategic purchasing tools.

**Solution:**
We created a robust SQL database to store drug prices and customer purchase data, developed a web scraper using Selenium to gather missing data, and implemented SQL queries to calculate potential savings from GPO rebates.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, HTML
- **Data Storage:** MySQL (hosted on LMU Build)
- **Software/Tools:** DBeaver, Visual Studio Code, Selenium

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive drug price database
- Automated web scraping for data collection
- Analytical tools for cost comparison and savings calculation

**Future Improvements:**
- Integrating data from additional supplier websites
- Enhancing the database with more detailed drug information
- Refining the web scraper for more efficient data extraction
